# Facial-Recognition
This project seeks to combine teachable AI with hardware to make a simplified Facial Recognition program. By the final stage of the project we want the AI able to turn on red or green LEDs if a person is o na preset list of acceptable people and to describe features of people in view.
For this project we will need: Google Teachable AI, Visual Studios, a web-cam, Arduino, a circuit board, a bread board, wires, LEDs (Green & Red).
